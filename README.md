# Website-Satisfaction-Survey-using-R

The dataset entails a survey conducted among website users, where they provided ratings. My initial step involved calculating the mean values of grades for individual subcategories to simplify interpretation.

I performed data cleaning, visualized the information, and applied an array of statistical and machine-learning models to determine the most effective approach.
